# Machine Learning with Python

This is an introductory course to machine learning. 

### Course Description

This is an introductory machine learning course designed for undergraduate students. It consists of two parts. The first part covers the basic idea behind machine learning and commonly used machine learning methods. In the second part, students practice machine learning methods by using Python programming language.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundemental concepts of machine learning
- Learn frequently used machine learning methods
- Practice with Python programming language
- Get used to machine learning development environment
