# Introduction to Data Science

## Course description

This course emphasizes identifying numerous business challenges in a digital era. In particular, as the volume of data generated from various entities increases, business applications's complexity is exponentially increasing as well. Therefore, it is crucial to address how to effectively utilize the concept of data science to effectively solve these newly created challenges in business applications.

## Learning objectives

1.	Identify newly created business challenges in a digital era
2.	Understand the unique advantages of data science
3.	Grasp currents trends of data science in a business environment
4.  Apply concepts and skills to real-world business problems
