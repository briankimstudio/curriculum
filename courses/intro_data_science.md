# Introduction to Data Science

## Course description

This course emphasizes identifying numerous challenges for both academics and practitioners in a digital era. In particular, as the volume of data generated from various entities increases, data processing applications' complexity increases exponentially. Therefore, it is crucial to address how to effectively utilize the concept of data science to solve these newly created challenges in a variety of business applications.

## Learning objectives

1.	To identify newly created business challenges in a digital era
2.	Understand the unique advantages of data science
3.	Grasp currents trends of data science in a business environment
4. Apply concepts and skills to real-world business problems

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of statistical analysis

## Modules

This course consists of 3 modules: Fundamentals, methodologies, and practices.

1. Fundamentals: Week 1 ~ 4
   - Focuses on the concepts and core elements of the data science
2. Methodologies: Week 5 ~ 10
   - Learn various techniques and usages
3. Practices: Week 11 ~ 16
   - Apply concepts and techniques to real-world problems
