# Introduction to Data Science

## Course description

This course emphasizes identifying numerous challenges in analyzing data for both academics and practitioners. In a digital era, researchers and practitioners face numerous challenges in analyzing data.  In particular, the volume, variety, and velocity of data have already exceeded the capacity of traditional data analytics methods. Therefore, it is imperative to find ways to leverage data science to solve these newly created challenges so that data-driven decisions can be made more effectively.

## Learning objectives

1. To identify newly created challenges in in analyzing data
2. To understand the unique advantages and in-depth knowledge of data science
3. To grasp currents trends in data science and examine them in the context of machine learning
4. To cultivate insights to formulate novel research questions
5. To provide students with real-world exposure and then apply concepts and skills to real-world problems.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of statistical analysis

## Modules

This course consists of 3 modules: Funedmentals, methodologies, and practices.

1. Fundamentals: Week 1 ~ 4
   - Focuses on the concepts and core elements of the data science
2. Methodologies: Week 5 ~ 10
   - Learn various techinques and usages
3. Practices: Week 11 ~ 16
   - Apply concepts and techniques to real-world problems
